#### Hello and welcome to my website — let me introduce myself

My name is Max, and I'm beginning to like computers.

It started with a few projects way beyond my skill level. They were horrible messes but I was proud and had loads of fun. I've been hooked ever since.

I graduated from Missouri Western State University in 2022 and was fortunate enough to find work in warehouse automation.

I'll write a little more about my work experience [here](#).

My personal projects can be found [here](#).


#### Skills

- Python – Comfortable with scripting, automation, focusing much more on organization now
- SQL - I can write simple queries pretty fast, once we need a pivot or something I need w3
- JavaScript / Node.js - defacto maintainer of our internal monitoring dashboard
- thought I had more skills. Dang it..
