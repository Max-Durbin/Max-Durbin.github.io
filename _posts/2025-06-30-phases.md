I wanted to make a simple data viewer in python to display db updates from tables I don't understand. Key references reveal connections but not purpose or the order data is processed in.

Some issues that justify this project 
- (data persistence) Sometimes processes don't go as expected and there are no logs or history tables to reference. I want a foolproof history to reference without questioning the accuracy or existence of logging or history tables
- (difficult navigation) Many tables are documented as separate but are actually combined into one large table were each type of record has it's own exclusive fields but may also share fields like 'id'. It's not obvious to me what fields go to what.
- (difficult navigation) There are around 50-80 completely unused fields per table used prior to 2011. Clutter makes the bloating and confusion worse.

To start I polled a query with a few tables from our db every 10 seconds. When the results were different I saved them to a csv file and called them snapshots. Stepping forward and backward through the snapshots turned out to be useful so I've been trying to make it more connivent to use.

Now I can tracing through process flows faster than I had been and figure out what fields are actually important to each step of a process in the db. 

Some useful options
- option: more/less width
- option: display - selected fields, selected fields + updated fields, only update fields.
- feature: Coloring changed fields as red when stepping through was helpful.

## Currently with this Project
Tracing processes manually is best but it's also impractically slow. I want to automate the steps of tracing a process as much as possible.
- Produce states/phases of data given polled data as csv's
- What states do a typical process go through? what fields define it?
- Many updates arn't very functional and clutter history.

*graph explanation*
- **Significant child fields** have been updated for **each** child before the parent was updated. (manually modifying one child record but not the others would not show up as significant)
- Child values (blue) are intersecting data of significant fields (values like status that are the same for all children)
- **Significant parent fields** are whatever updated after all children have had a similar update, those fields are verified against multiple parents. 
- While parent fields intersectional like childrens fields their values are not, instead a random parent gets all it's data displayed (need to come back to this).

**Goals**  
I can't tell you how excited I am. Recently I've made good progress debugging some difficult problems and I'm feeling very hopeful that this project might be a launching point for better tools.

Display:  
- Write and populate a basic data validator with these states 
- Show what tables/fields a process is likely waiting/stuck on

Control:  
- Reverse process into validated state for mistakes - (undo function)
