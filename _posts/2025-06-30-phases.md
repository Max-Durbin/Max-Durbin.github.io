I wanted to make a simple data viewer in python to display db updates

Some issues that justify this project 
- Sometimes processes don't go as expected and there are no logs or history tables to reference. I wanted a foolproof history to reference without questioning the accuracy or existence of logging or history tables
- Many tables are documented as separate but are actually combined into one large table were each type of records has exclusive fields
- There are completely unused fields. About 50-80 unused fields per table used prior to 2011

I polled our db every 10 seconds and when the results were different I saved them to a csv file.
Then wrote some functions to navigate the csv files and display changes. Stepping forward and backward through polled query results turned out to be useful so I kept trying to make it more connivent to use.

It's not amazing but it helped me trace through process flows faster than I had been and figure out what fields were actually important to each step of a process in the db. 

Some useful options
- option: more/less width
- option: display - selected fields, selected fields + updated fields, only update fields.
- feature: Coloring changed fields as red when stepping through was helpful.

## New Ideas
I'm spending allot of time stepping through processes and want to automate identifying significant updates and important fields.

**so far**  
- significant fields are those that have to be updated for each child before the parent will go to next update
- if fields are updated but appear inconsequential to the parent updating we don't care about them for that parent
- We display a child rows data for an update if it intersects in a field
- parents always get their field values displayed
- parents are purple children are blue

**Goals**  
This project needs to say "*yeah x updates have happened in the right order and the 1:1 and 1:m relationships are correct*" or if there's something out of order or missing then that should raise an alert.
