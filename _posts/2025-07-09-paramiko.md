### Summary
The paramiko library gives ssh to your pythong script.
I wanted to use it for searching our logs.

The normal process for navigating log files- 
1. Use winSCP (stfp app) to navigate the server log directories.
2. Download logs that might contain clues about an error based on service and time.

I wanted a wider search in chronological order.
- raw greps have lots of white space
- highlight matches
- maintain horizontal space - display when differnt only, delete white space

I worked on this for a really long time, most features were not usefull. 
The best thing was just chronology and recursive searching. 
It turns out this can be achieved with grep and sort!
