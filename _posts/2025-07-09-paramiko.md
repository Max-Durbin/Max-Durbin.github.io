### Summary
paramiko could be a helpful ssh library if you do something repetitive in putty.

## Automating a common task
Normal process for navigating log files- 
When we want to review why a service altered some suspicious looking records we'll usually do this.
1. Navigate the log directories for that service and a time frame.
2. Download logs that might contain clues from sftp app
3. Search through them using a text editor on our machine

Recursive grep and sort in putty is much faster than downloading just to search in a text editor

There are still issues
- inconsistent columns/timestamps make sort hit/miss
- rolling logs mixed with non rolling logs
- raw greps have lots of white space

I really want to see the logs from whatever services messed with my data in chronological order. 
Script
1. Grab services like service_keyword - tell me what services matched before searching
2. Search those services log files for any mention of a keyword
3. Return the the results in chronological order with a few context lines above/below
