### Summary
The paramiko ssh library was useful for a repetitive task in putty.

## Scripting a common task
Normal process for navigating log files- 
1. Navigate the log directories for that service and a time frame.
2. Download logs that might contain clues from sftp app
3. Search through them using a text editor on our machine


New method - *Recursive grep - but there are issues* -
- inconsistent columns/timestamps make sort hit/miss
- rolling logs mixed with non rolling logs
- raw greps have lots of white space

I just want to see the logs from whatever services that messed up the data in chronological order. 

Script Objectives -
1. Find services like service_keyword
2. Search those services log files for any mention of a keyword
3. Return the the results in chronological order with a few context lines above/below each match

This helps clarify if something exist or if I'm looking in the wrong place. It also helps me put events in order and saves me from some horizontal scrolling.

The code is bloated for something that could have been done with grep piped into sort but at the time I didn't know what I wanted. I'd like to come back to this and just pipe the grep into a sort by timestamp. I'm not sure if sort can compare different timestamps types - something for later.
